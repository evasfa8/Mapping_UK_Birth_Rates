Mapping UK Birth Rates

This project is my assignment for the PSY6422 Data Analysis and Visualisation module. 

It presents a line graph illustrating the changes in birth rates from 1950 to 2023 in the united kingdom, and was created using Rmarkdown. 

The files above include:

Birth_Rate_Data.xlsx <- raw data before cleaning.

Index.rmd and Index.html <- code for the data processing and final visualisation.  

birth_rates.gif, birth_rates.html and births.png <- key visualisations

df.csv <- processed data after cleaning.
