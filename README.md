Mapping UK Birth Rates

This project is my assignment for the PSY6422 Data Analysis and Visualisation module. 

It presents a line graph illustrating the changes in birth rates from 1950 to 2023 in the united kingdom, and was created using Rmarkdown. 

The files above include:

Raw_data – data before cleaning, alongside a codebook detailing data origins and variable information. 

Processed_data - data after cleaning, alongside a codebook.

Figs – key visualisations

Script – code for the data processing and final visualisation.
